Condition,Recommended Crop Portfolio,Rationale
Drought-prone & sandy soil,"Millet, Groundnut, Cowpea","Drought-tolerant, nitrogen-fixing legumes improve soil and yield under dry conditions"
High rainfall & loamy soil,"Cassava, Maize, Vegetables",Good yield potential in high-rain zones; root and leafy crops thrive in loam
Short growing season (<100 days),"Tomato, Cowpea, Sweetcorn",Fast-maturing crops fit within short windows; low rainfall exposure
Flood-prone lowland,"Rice (upland or lowland), Cowpea",Tolerant crops with resilience to waterlogging and humidity
Degraded soil with low fertility,"Sorghum, Soybean, Cowpea",Legumes and hardy grains restore fertility and stabilize productivity
First season after heavy nutrient user (e.g. maize),"Soybean, Cowpea, Groundnut",Nitrogen-fixers improve soil after high extraction; breaks pest cycles
Farmer wants low-cost input crops,"Cowpea, Sorghum, Cassava",Low fertilizer and chemical needs; adaptable for low-budget farmers
