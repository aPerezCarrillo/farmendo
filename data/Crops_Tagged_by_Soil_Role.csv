Crop,Soil Role,Rationale
Cowpea,Improver,"Fixes nitrogen, improves soil fertility"
Maize,Depleter,"High nutrient demand, depletes nitrogen and phosphorus"
Cassava,Tolerant,"Tolerates poor soils, minimal improvement or depletion"
Groundnut,Improver,Fixes nitrogen and improves organic content
Sorghum,Tolerant,"Adapted to marginal soils, low fertilizer need"
Soybean,Improver,"Nitrogen-fixer, enhances soil structure and fertility"
Yam,Depleter,"Extracts high nutrients, especially potassium"
Tomato,Depleter,"Heavy feeder, reduces soil nutrient balance"
