Crop A (Just Harvested),Recommended Next Crops,Rationale
Maize,"Cowpea, Soybean, Vegetables",Legumes improve nitrogen in soil; vegetables benefit from residual fertility
Cassava,"Maize, Soybean, Cowpea",Cereal crops follow root crops well; legumes improve nitrogen for next cycle
Groundnut,"Maize, Sorghum, Millet",Cereals benefit from improved soil structure and nutrient availability
Rice,"Cowpea, Cassava, Vegetables",Legumes help restore soil after paddy; cassava thrives in post-rice beds
Sorghum,"Groundnut, Soybean, Maize",Diversifies pests and nutrient demands; breaks cereal disease cycles
Tomato,"Okra, Cowpea, Sweetcorn",Follows short-season crop; legumes improve soil; okra helps with deep rooting
Cowpea,"Sorghum, Millet, Maize",Rotating to cereals breaks pest cycles and diversifies income sources
